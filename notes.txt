Project Notes

Maybe use int *pc when knowing if there will be a jump branch or jump address
if statement if jumping will be used and update *pc with jump target.

Control Unit:
Opcode of instruction will be used for generating selector values
regWrite: if we write to register?
regDst: rs, rt, rd location for read or write
branch: zero from alu
aluSrc: If we need to add two registers or add one register with sign extension to find memory(lw)
ALU code needs function from machine code
memWrite: if we write to memory?
memToReg: If we write the result from alu or from memory
memRead: If we read from memory?
instType: 2 bit code for instruction type, and function field used for ALU Control

lw/sw instType = 00     ALU function = add alu_op = 0010
beq instType = 01       ALU function = subtract alu_op = 0110
R-type instType = 10    ALU function = funct code with alu_op = below

ALU Control:
alu_op  Function
0000    and 
0001    or
0010    add
0110    subtract
0111    slt
1100    nor

For R-Type instructions, regWrite, regDst, instType = 1, 1, 10 respectively

For lw regWrite, aluSrc, instType, memToReg, memToRead = 1, 1, 00, 1, 1 respectively

For beq branch, instType =
